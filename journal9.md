#Journal 9

Week 3 is finally fucking over.  I mean....  OMG!  Struggle after struggle after struggle after struggle after struggle.

That said, I learned so much this week.  SO many nuance things to balance and do.  So many dependencies for environemt to function properly.  Trying to track one piece of data through the entire cycle.  These are just a few of my struggles and victories this week.

Perhaps my biggest victory is that I am still here.  Walking through the doors this morning made me feel like a boss, knowing I am in the minority of people willing to make a change in their life, and sticking through it when times are tough, to me is what it is all about.
