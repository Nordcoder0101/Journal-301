#Journal 4

Was out sick today and that sucks.  Still was able to watch the lecture and try to keep up with the content.  I find it's much more difficult to learn when I can't be present to ask questions. 

Nice to start learning the basics of working with other sites.  AJAX seems really useful and helpful.  It will be fun to start implementing this!
