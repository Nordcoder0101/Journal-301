#Journal 8

OMG, this effing week is killing me.  This is truly one of the most challenging weeks of my life in the context of learning and challening my intellectual capactiy.  I am not feeling very smart or capable at the moment.  I am struggling every day just to get my machine in a place where I can write on line of code.  

Working with Yohanes is awesome though.  Really fun guy to work with.  I might be a little more advanced than him on this material, but for the most part him and I are in the same spot on the struggle bus.  Having someone to commiserate with and feel the same joys has really been comforting.
